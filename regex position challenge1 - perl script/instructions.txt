Given:
my $string = "toy='truck' color='red' cat='purrdy' dogs='beagle' car='toyota' doggy='mut' apple='delicious' dog='shepherd' colour='blue'";

Locate the property instances of dog, dogs, or doggy.
Find the property value for the instance. That is, find what they are set equal to. This means finding what is in the '' after the = after dog, dogs, or doggy.

Determine the start and end character positions for each property value (the part in the '').

For each found instance, print:
