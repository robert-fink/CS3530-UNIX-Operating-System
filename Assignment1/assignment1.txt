1. Write a shell script that performs the following:

- accepts a filename, either by prompt or parameter

- checks to see if a file by that filename already exists in the current working directory

- if file exists, copy the existing file to a new file of the same name, only with .bak and the current date appended to the name

(eg myfile.txt becomes myfile.txt.bak09152016)

- if the backup file already exists the script should ask if you want to replace it, and act accordingly



2. Using the "select" menu creation system available to BASH scripts, create a small menu-driven calculator.

Each function should take two parameters.

Implement the following arithmetic as menu options: +, -, *, /, %



You will be graded on the functionality of your scripts as well as choices of commands and understandability of your code and comments.

You will submit your work as two separate text files, following this naming convention: cs3530_<pawprint>_assignment1_part1.txt

cs3530_<pawprint>_assignment1_part2.txt
